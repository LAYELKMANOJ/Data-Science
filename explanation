This Python-based data science project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using the Random Forest Classifier. It begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and several components from scikit-learn for model building and evaluation. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. The features (X) and target variable (y) are separated, and the data is then split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to ensure the model can be evaluated properly. To ensure consistent performance, feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler, which standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

A RandomForestClassifier with 100 decision trees is then trained on the preprocessed training data. Once the model is trained, it makes predictions on the unseen test data. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and a full classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics give a clear picture of how well the model performs. Additionally, the confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap created with Seaborn to make the classification performance easy to interpret at a glance. Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for building, evaluating, and visualizing a classification model using real-world data in Python.
